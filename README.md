This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Router
The routers are dynamic and file-based.

### Link
I use next/link instead of traditional anchor in html to link in the same website, and the benefits are not reloading while clicking the pages(it prefetched the contents), thus impoves more efficiency.
